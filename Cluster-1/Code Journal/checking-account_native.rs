/*
1) What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)

===> iterators - next_account_info iterates through the account array and returns it
a mutable account iterator is used in this program to assign the account info to variables 

2) What is the organization?

===>The program requires you to pass the required arguments and for accounts you need to pass 
the right number of accounts in right order


3)What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism? 

===> This program is used to perform checks on insturctions passed in to ensure that the only the required
accounts in exactly specified order is passed. 

We are also checking the lamports of accounts to check if they're initialized or not

4)How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?

===> If only there was a better way to do account validation ;) 
***************Ahem Anchor to the Rescue! Maybe??**********************

5)The code could be safer and better ifâ€¦..
